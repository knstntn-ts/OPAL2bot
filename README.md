# OPAL2bot
This bot is used for extracting a parameter from online calculator used for the design of solar cells.

On the [PVLighthouse website](https://www.google.com](https://www2.pvlighthouse.com.au/calculators/opal%202/opal%202.aspx) it inputs the necessary parameters and extracts the generated current value for the entered set of parameters.

## Getting started
To get started all you need to do is to download main.py from this directory and run it in IDE of your choice.
You also need to have a chrome driver for running Google Chrome in automated manner. Then change 'CHROME_DRIVER_PATH' variable to the downloaded Chrome Driver, and hit run, go and get some nap while OPAL2Bot does the job for you ;)

## Issues
Feel free to roast this work ;) I will check out how it can be improved.
