# OPAL2bot
This bot is used for extracting a parameter from online calculator used for the design of solar cells.

On [PVLighthouse](https://www2.pvlighthouse.com.au/calculators/opal%202/opal%202.aspx) it inputs the necessary parameters and extracts the generated current value for the entered set of parameters.

## Getting started
To get started all you need to do is to download main.py from this directory and run it in IDE of your choice.
You also need to have Chrome Driver for running Google Chrome in automated manner. Then change 'CHROME_DRIVER_PATH' variable to where you saved Chrome Driver, and hit run. Now go and get some nap while OPAL2Bot does the job for you ;)

## Issues
Feel free to roast this work ;) I will check out how it can be improved.
